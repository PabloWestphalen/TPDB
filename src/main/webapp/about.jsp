    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <h3>First, a Little Story</h3>
    <blockquote>If every day we find a new song here, we're gonna be happier people.
    Each one shares what they have, and everyone's got something to share.</blockquote>
    <p>This motto was the premise of <em class="under" lang="pt-br" title="1 Trip-Hop [song] a day">1 Trip-Hop por dia</em>,
    an Orkut community created in 2006 that,
    for a time, was a nice, centralized place to discover and share new Trip-Hop
    music among the genre's fans in Brazil. Unfortunately, though, while other communities
    at that time overflowed with members, this one never reached a mere thousand.
    Its activity once peaked for a couple of months, but soon became very sporadic,
    with posts few and far between.</p>
    <h3>The Problems</h3>
    <p>The story isn't limited to this specific community. It's happened time and time again.
    You can find <strong>dozens</strong> of websites, forums, blogs and groups on the Internet
    that focus on this loved genre of ours, but they all seem to eventually get abandoned,
    forgotten, leaving only traces of something that if was still active today, would
    surely be awesome. With a quick analyzis, one could determine that some of
    the reasons for this to happen are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>There's an usual lack of feedback to the contributors.</strong> People used their time to craft and post a
    contribution, expecting to instigate a discussion, a quick comment if anything, but
    instead were faced with nothing but silence. Posting then may have felt like a waste of time.</li>
    <li><strong>The communities simply ran their courses.</strong> People did share what was there to share, but
    eventually ran out of material (i.e.: artists no longer produced music that fit the
    genre). For all intents and purposes, Trip-Hop was deemed by many as "dead".</li>
    <li><strong>The communities are dispersed and aimed at a very niche audience.</strong> Trip-Hop may be world-wide known,
    but it surely isn't popular. Specially outside of Europe. Now, if you take this tiny fraction of fans, and further
    divide them into several smaller and isolated groups, not much is going to come out of them individually.
    We would need this one, big central hub...
    </li>   
    </ul>
    <h3>Inspiration</h3>
    <p>You see, I love Trip-Hop. I've loved many songs that fit the genre before I even knew the term. And the thing is,
    I can't get enough of it. Remember the opening quote, up there? I'm a guy that truly gets happier upon discovering
    a new Trip-Hop song. And I know for a fact that I'm not the only one. Sadly, fans of the genre like me are in a Tricky
    position. It's not easy to find this kind of music. You don't switch to MTV, wait for a while and get presented with
    a fresh, daily selection of new songs. No. You have to dig. Like you're mining for gold. You dig and  you dig.
    Most of the time you won't find anything of use, but there are some times - oh, wonderful times -, when you do happen
    to stumble upon that sweet tune. And that makes it all so worth it. But it's still hard.</p>
    <p>Suppose you're English. How the hell are you supposed to know that this new little band in, who knows,
    Bolivia, just released this amazing album? Well, you're not. If only there were this site that catalogued EVERY FREAKING
    Trip-Hop record released in the world! Man, now that'd be nice.</p>
    <p>But wait. Hold that thought. I'm a Web Developer! Though fairly ambicious and probably doomed to fail, I could still
    try to make a site like that come to life. In fact, I <em>must</em> try.</p>
    <h3>Enter The Trip-Hop Database</h3>
    <p>The Trip-Hop Database is my attempt at making the site I wish I could've always gone to, because I think that the problems
    mentioned before can, perhaps, be addressed. For starters, I don't believe that Trip-Hop is dead. I strongly believe that
    it's still out there, being composed by creative and talented musicians. It's just not getting its due exposure, and therefore
    is rendered hard to come across. With that in mind, all it would need is just for people around the world to help catalogue
    these records in a central database (much like a collaborative wiki).</p>
