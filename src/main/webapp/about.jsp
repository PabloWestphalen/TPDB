      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <blockquote>If every day we find a new song here, we're
        gonna be happier people. Each one shares what they have, and
        everyone's got something to share.</blockquote>
      <p>
        This motto was the premise of <em class="under" lang="pt-br"
          title="1 Trip-Hop [song] a day">1 Trip-Hop por dia</em> , an Orkut
        community created in 2006 that, for a time, was a nice, centralized
        place to discover and share new Trip-Hop music among the genre's
        fans in Brazil. Its activity once peaked for a couple of months, but
        soon became very sporadic, with posts few and far between. Attempts
        have been made to keep the community alive, but none of them
        succeeded. The ultimate purpose of this site is to keep the spirit
        of that motto alive.

      <h3>Inspiration</h3>
      <p>You see, I love Trip-Hop. I've loved many songs that fit the
        genre before I even knew the term. And the thing is, I can't get
        enough of it. Remember the opening quote, up there? I'm a guy that
        truly gets happier upon discovering a new Trip-Hop song. And I know
        for a fact that I'm not the only one. Sadly, fans of the genre like
        me are in a Tricky position (get the pun?). It's not easy to find
        this kind of music. You don't switch to MTV, wait for a while and
        get presented with a fresh, daily selection of new songs. No. You
        have to dig. Like you're mining for gold. You dig and you dig. Most
        of the time you won't find anything of use, but there are some times
        - oh, wonderful times -, when you do happen to stumble upon that
        sweet tune. And that makes it all so worth it. But it's still hard.</p>
      <p>Suppose you're English. How the hell are you supposed to know
        that this new little band in, who knows, Bolivia, just released this
        amazing album? You're not. If only there were this site that
        catalogued EVERY FREAKING Trip-Hop record released in the world!
        Man, now that'd be nice.</p>
      <p>
        But what am i saying? I'm a goddamn Web Developer! Though fairly
        ambicious, I could still try to make a site like that come to
        life. In fact, I <em>must</em> try.
      </p>
      <h3>Enter The Trip-Hop Database</h3>
      <p>The Trip-Hop Database is my attempt at making the site I wish
        I could've always gone to, because I don't believe that Trip-Hop is
        dead. I strongly believe that it's still out there, being composed
        by creative and talented musicians. It's just not getting its due
        exposure, and therefore is rendered hard to come across. With that
        in mind, all it would need is just for people around the world to
        help catalogue these records in a central database (much like a
        collaborative wiki).</p>editando na etec
