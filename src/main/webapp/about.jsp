    <blockquote>If every day we find a new song over here, we're going to be happier people.
    Each one shares what they have, and everyone's got something to share.</blockquote>
    <p>This raw, yet inspiring statement was the premise of "1 Trip-Hop por dia"
    (1 Trip-Hop [song] a day), an Orkut community created in 2006 that in Brazil,
    for a time, was a nice, centralized place to discover and share new Trip-Hop
    music among the genre's fans. Unfortunately, though, while other communities
    at that time overflowed with members, this one never reached a mere thousand.
    Its activity once peaked for a couple of months, but soon became very sporadic,
    with posts few and far between. With a quick analyzis one could determine that some of
    the reasons for this to happen were that:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The community was aimed at a very niche audience. Trip-Hop may be world-wide known,
    but it surely isn't popular.</li>
    <li>Lack of feedback to the contributions. People used their time to craft and post a
    contribution, expecting to instigate a discussion, a quick comment if anything, but
    instead faced silence. Posting then may have felt like a waste of time.</li>
    <li>The community simply ran its course. People did share what was there to share, but
    eventually ran out of material (i.e.: artists no longer produced music that fit the
    genre). For all intents and purposes, Trip-Hop was "dead".</li>
    </ul>
    The story i tell you is not particular to this specific Orkut community. I've seen it
    happen before. You can find DOZENS of websites, forums, blogs and groups on the internet
    that focus on this loved genre of ours, but they all seem to eventually be abandoned,
    forgotten, leaving only traces of something that if was really active today, would
    surely be awesome.
